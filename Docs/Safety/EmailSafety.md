# Email Safety

* Never unsubscribe or reply to any unwanted email. Many spam emails contain a link to unsubscribe. Usually, this is nothing but a way to confirm a working email address.
* Be aware of common online scams
* Never send any sensitive information over email. When you send such email, you will no longer have control over what is done with it or to whom it is getting forwarded. Sensitive information such as passwords, bank account numbers, CVV numbers should never be sent over email. The bank is the best example that will never ask for personal information in an email.
* Email filter — If you have not already applied this, it is highly recommended that you activate the spam filter for your email. If your email software has a “report spam” or “this is spam” button, USE IT!
* Avoid replying to or clicking on any link inside spam emails.
* Avoid opening an attachment from a company or person you don’t know (or someone, you were not expecting an email from). These attachments may have malicious codes such as viruses which can severely damage your computer. Move such kind of emails to your spam folder always. There exist some client-side attacks that can be performed by an attacker if there is some unpatched vulnerability that exists in your system software, which can be leveraged. For example, Internet Explorer 8 is vulnerable to Fixed Col Span ID exploit.
* Remember to logout, specially if you are using a public computer, such as at the library or an Internet cafe, and close the browser. It’s quick, easy, and may save your account from unwanted hackers.
* Use anti-virus software. It is highly recommended that you install and maintain good anti-virus software on your computer to prevent infection. Scan all email attachments with a virus program before downloading.
* Change your email password frequently and don’t share it with anyone. It’s recommended to change passwords at least every 60 days, And never share your password with anyone.
* Avoid bulk mail. Bulk email messages can become extremely frustrating. To avoid this, Don’t give your email address to sites you don’t trust.

**Lastly, Safety doesn’t happen by accident. Before you act, THINK.**
