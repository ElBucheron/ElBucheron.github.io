# Network Attacks

## Reconnaissance Attacks
Also known as information gathering, is the unauthorised discovery and mapping of systems, services or vulnerabilities.

* Information query (DNS quries, whois, nslookup)
* Ping/ICMP sweeps of a target
* Port scan
* Run Vulnerability Scanners
* Run Exploitation tools

## Access Attacks

* Password attacks
* Trust exploitation
* Port rederiction
* Man-in-the-middle
* Buffer overflow
* IP, MAC, DHCP spoofing
* Social engineering

## Denial of Service Attacks (DoS)

Interupt a service to users, devices or applications.

* Ping of death
* Smurf attack
* TCP SYN flood attack

DDoS Attacks are similar to DoS attacks but with a higher magnitude because it originates from multiple and coordinated sources.

**Botnet** - A network of infected hosts
**Zombies** - Compromised computers
**Handler System** - controls the zombies

## Components of security

* Confidentiality
* Integrity
* Availabilty

## Network Security Domains

**Risk Assessment** - Determining the quantitative & qualitative value of risk related to a specific threat
**Security Policy** - Document that addresses contraints & behaviors of employees & how data is
accessed
**Organisation of Information Security** - Governance model set out by an organisation for
information security
**Asset Management** - Inventory of information assets & classification scheme for them
**Human Resources Security** - Security procedures for employees joining, moving within or leaving
company
**Physical & Environmental Security** - Describes protection of computer facilities within company
**Communications and Operations Management** - Describes management of technical security
controls in systems & networks
**Information Systems Acquisition, Development & Maintenance** - Describes integration of
security into applications
**Access Control** - Describes restriction of access rights to networks, systems, applications & data
**Information Security Incident Management** - Describes how to respond to information security
breaches
**Business continuity management** - Describes protection, maintenance & recovery of business-
critical processes & systems
**Compliance** - Describes process of ensuring conformance with information security policies,
standards & regulations

## Defending the Network

* Develop a written security policy
* Educate employees about the risks of social engineering, and develop strategies to validate identities over the phone, via email or in person
* Control physical access to systems
* Use strong passwords and change them often
* Encrypt and password-protect sensitive data
* Implement security hardware and software
* Perform backups and test the backed up files on a regular basis
* Shut down unnecessary services and ports
* Keep patches up-to-date by installing them weekly or daily to prevent buffer overflow and privilege escalation attacks
* Perform security audits to test the network
